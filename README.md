# Tariff recommendation

The mobile operator "Megaline" found out that many customers use archival tariffs. They want to build a system that can analyze customer behavior and offer users a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra".
[I have data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these tariffs] (https://github.com/limenbah/tariff-for-a-telecom-company). You need to build a model for the classification problem that will select the appropriate rate.
It is necessary to build a model with the highest possible accuracy value. To pass the project successfully, you need to bring the percentage of correct answers to at least 0.75.
